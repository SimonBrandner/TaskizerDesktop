# Taskizer Desktop

Taskizer Desktop is a desktop client for the the Taskizer App. Taskizer is task-management app. It is not dependent on any backend, therefore there is no necessity to pay for a server, thus the app can be completely free. The projects and config are saved in JSON format making them easily readable. I am planning on implementing sync using third-party cloud services like Google Drive and others.

It was built using Angular and Electron.
